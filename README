cooka
------------------------------------------
Cooka is a very simple image viewer written in C# (less than 900 lines 
of code, comments included) and compiled with Mono framework. The 
application is really essential: it has a file system browser in order 
to select the folder containing images to display; a thumbs viewer 
useful to see a preview of the images within the selected folder and 
some information like image's name, size and dimension; and finally a 
"view" area used to display the selected image.
